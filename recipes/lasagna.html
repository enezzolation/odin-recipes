                    Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent.
                    Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.
